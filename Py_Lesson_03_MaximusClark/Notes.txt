For variables with more than one word in it, the second and following words should start with a capital letter (firstName not firstname)

Lower case words are easy to read than upper case words

Underscores can be used as spaces between words in a multi-word name

Function calls should end with parenthesis [functionName()]

One very important built in function is input()

Taking user input is easy, this is a prompt on how to get it, variableName = input(“write in text here”), the input it gets are strings

variableName from before will be equal to what the users type

Casting allows us to take one kind of data and turn it into another
