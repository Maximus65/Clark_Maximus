Python Data Types
After learning about variable initialization and assignment, you should be aware that data types are serious business. They can determine the success or failure of your project. Therefore, you should know them extremely well. This document should serve as a quick reference guide for the data types we will be using most often in this class. Research each of the terms below and write their definitions in the boxes below
 
str : String is the datatype that represents text

Integer: Signed integers, meaning they carry no fractional (decimal) part, and can be positive or negative

Float: In the most simple terms, a float is the datatype of decimal numbers

list: List of data tables that are the same

tuple:  An unchangeable list
